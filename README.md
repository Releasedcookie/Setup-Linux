# setup-linux
A program to easily install linux how I like it :)


## Setting up ubuntu
Download the file
`git clone https://github.com/Releasedcookie/setup-linux.git`

Move into the directory just installed
`cd setup-linux`

Change the permission of the file so you can execute it
`chmod +x setup-ubuntu.sh`

Run the file as sudo
`sudo ./setup-ubuntu.sh`

### Copy the below into a terminal for full automation :)

'''
git clone https://github.com/Releasedcookie/setup-linux.git
cd setup-linux
chmod +x setup-ubuntu.sh
sudo ./setup-ubuntu.sh
```
